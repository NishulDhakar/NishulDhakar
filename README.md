# Hey there, I'm Nishul

## About me

- I'm a full stack developer who loves building modern web applications with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, focusing on creating seamless user experiences with clean code and attention to detail.
- Tech stack isn't my concern, I'm flexible with whatever the project needs, though I prefer modern frameworks and tools like Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and AI technologies. I'm always open for new opportunities to learn and grow.
- If you love what I build and do, then please consider sponsoring me.
