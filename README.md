# Hey there, I'm Nishul

## About me

- I build end-to-end products from idea to production. Working across frontend, backend, and AI systems, I take ownership of the entire lifecycle design, build, deploy, and iterate, focused on shipping real results.
- Tech stack doesn’t scare me — I learn whatever the project needs. I like modern tools, AI, and figuring things out fast… basically a professional problem solver with a keyboard.
